# Fix Patterns

**Read when**: After completing a bug fix.

This document defines the recording template and archival rules for fix experiences.

## Fix Entry Template

Each fix record uses the following format:

```markdown
### [Short Title]
- **Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
- **Symptom**: What the user observed (error message / abnormal behavior)
- **Root Cause**: Root cause analysis (one sentence)
- **Fix**: What was changed (files involved and key modifications)
- **Lesson**: Implications for future development (why this happened, how to prevent it)
- **Related Constraint**: If a new hard constraint was created, reference the constraint number (N/A if none)
```

## Archival Location Decision Table

Based on the fix type, write the fix entry to the appropriate document:

| Fix Type | Archival Location | Example |
|----------|------------------|---------|
| Violated an existing constraint | `constraints.md` — add "common violation case" under the relevant entry | Forgot to update registry path |
| Discovered a new hard constraint | `constraints.md` — new entry | Found ZeRO-2 + EMA incompatibility |
| Architecture / data-flow misunderstanding | `architecture.md` — relevant module section | Misunderstood preprocess_func call timing |
| Subsystem-specific pitfall | `topics/<topic>.md` — corresponding topic | Sampler boundary condition |
| Does not fit any of the above | This document's "Recorded Fix Patterns" section below | Append as a new record |

**Decision flow**: Check whether the fix matches the first four rows; if none match, fall back to this document.

## Recorded Fix Patterns

<!-- This section accumulates over time. Append new records at the end using the template above. -->

- `architecture.md` (archival target for data-flow misunderstandings)
